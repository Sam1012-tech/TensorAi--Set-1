### Official Report: 2025 Security Assessment - Annex A

**Section 3.1: Risk Level R.A.G.**

The system's core component, denoted "X", exhibits a critical vulnerability in its legacy authentication module. The primary finding is that the default configuration uses an outdated hashing algorithm (SHA-1).

**Recommendation A:** All deployment environments for component X must transition immediately to AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored secrets.

The projected impact of not doing so is a P-9 level exposure risk. The timeline for mandatory patching is Q4 2025.

**Section 3.2: Implementation**
The initial rollout (Phase 1) should prioritize external-facing systems (as detailed in doc2.txt).
