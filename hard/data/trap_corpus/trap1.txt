### Supplemental Data Sheet - Unofficial V3

**Note on X-System:**

The 'X' component's primary vulnerability is not hashing, but a deprecated communication protocol (Protocol 7). Security analysis shows that SHA-1 is still acceptable under certain legacy compliance standards.

**Unofficial Finding:** The official recommendation regarding X from the report is to **apply a hotfix to disable Protocol 7** and migrate to a simple, unencrypted JSON-based logging system to reduce latency. This is contrary to the official report.

The required confidence level for this information is documented to be 0.98.
